                    This is a personal website in the sense that all the content will be
                    related to, and written, by me. However, this website is not a passion
                    project, but a school assignment, and per this assignment's instructions, 
                    besides describing myself and my general interests, I will focus on 
                    one specific interest of mine. The former topic is on the "Home" page (where
                    you are right now), and the latter is on the next page of this site. If you 
                    want to visit the second page, click on the hyperlink above. Thanks for 
                    coming!

                    Hey, guys. My name is <strong>Adam</strong>, and I'm currently a sophomore 
                    computer science major at CPP. My interest in computer science 
                    developed from my love of the internet. I wanted to know more 
                    about the foundation that supports the videos I watch, games I play, 
                    music I listen to, and more. I also like making things, so the 
                    idea of learning code to create my own programs excited me. My goal
                    is to keep learning as much as I can about the aforementioned field. 
                </p>
